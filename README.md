# Employee Attrition Prediction - CipherSchool Project

This project aims to predict employee attrition (i.e., whether an employee is likely to leave the company) using logistic regression. The dataset includes employee information like monthly income, age, job satisfaction, overtime status, and more.

## 📊 Features Used
- `MonthlyIncome`
- `Age`
- `JobSatisfaction`
- `YearsAtCompany`
- `OverTime` (Yes/No)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn (LogisticRegression, train_test_split, accuracy_score)

## 📁 Files
- `CipherSchool_Project.ipynb`: Main notebook with code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `your_file.csv`: Dataset used (assumed, replace with actual name if included)

## ✅ Workflow
1. Load and clean the dataset
2. Encode categorical features
3. Handle missing values
4. Train/test split
5. Logistic Regression model training
6. Accuracy evaluation

## 📈 Output
- Accuracy score of the trained model on test data
- Optional: classification report, confusion matrix (can be added)

## 💡 Future Enhancements
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Model comparison (e.g., RandomForest, SVM)
- Web deployment using Flask/Streamlit

## 🤝 Contributors
- Tanisha Rani – Developed as part of the CipherSchool program
