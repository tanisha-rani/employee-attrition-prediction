📚 AI/ML Summer Projects – CipherSchools Internship

This repository contains three AI/ML projects developed during my summer training with CipherSchools. Each project focuses on applying machine learning and AI techniques to solve real-world problems in different domains — HR analytics, natural language processing, and computer vision.

1️⃣ Employee Attrition Prediction (Final Assignment)

Goal: Predict whether an employee is likely to leave the company using logistic regression.
Domain: HR Analytics

🔹 Features Used

MonthlyIncome

Age

JobSatisfaction

YearsAtCompany

OverTime (Yes/No)

🔹 Tech Stack

Python, Pandas, Matplotlib

Scikit-learn (LogisticRegression, train_test_split, accuracy_score)

🔹 Workflow

Load and clean dataset

Encode categorical features

Handle missing values

Train/test split

Train Logistic Regression model

Evaluate model accuracy

🔹 Future Enhancements

Hyperparameter tuning

Model comparison with RandomForest, SVM

Web deployment using Flask/Streamlit


2️⃣ AI-Powered Multi-Language Chatbot

Goal: Build a chatbot that generates dynamic responses in multiple languages using Ollama and Streamlit.
Domain: Natural Language Processing

🔹 Features

No fixed answer set — generates fresh responses dynamically

Multi-language support (English, Hindi, Punjabi, etc.)

Runs locally with Ollama (no API dependency)

Web interface using Streamlit

🔹 Tech Stack

Python

Ollama (Local AI model runner)

Streamlit

LangChain (optional, if integrated)

🔹 Workflow

Install and set up Ollama

Build chatbot interface in Streamlit

Integrate multi-language response handling

Test with multiple languages and queries

🔹 Future Enhancements

Voice input/output

Database/API integration

Cloud deployment for remote access


3️⃣ Fashion Item Image Classification using HOG + SVM

Goal: Classify fashion images into categories like T-shirt, Trouser, Sneaker, etc., using Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) and Support Vector Machine (SVM).
Domain: Computer Vision

🔹 Dataset

Fashion MNIST (60,000 training images, 10,000 testing images)

🔹 Tech Stack

Python

TensorFlow/Keras (to load dataset)

Scikit-image (HOG feature extraction)

Scikit-learn (SVM model)

Matplotlib (visualization)

🔹 Workflow

Load and explore Fashion MNIST dataset

Normalize and reshape images

Extract HOG features

Train SVM classifier

Test and visualize predictions

🔹 Future Enhancements

Use CNNs for improved accuracy

Handle colored images

Build a web app for live classification
